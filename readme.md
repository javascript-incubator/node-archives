- `yarn start:prod` to start server on older node versions.
- `yarn deploy` to deploy to heroku.

### Usage

- *GET* `/chain` to get chain.

### Internals

#### Proof of Work

- SHA256
- Hash-based message authentication code(HMAC) to generate hash of last block.

All the functions used are from [cypto](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html) included in node.
